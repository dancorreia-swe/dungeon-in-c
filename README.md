# Dungeon in C üè∞

*Dungeon in C* is a monolithic project carried out in the first semester of the information systems college program.

## Summary

The game is an adaptation of a choose-your-own-adventure book from the *Fighting Fantasy* series written by Ian Livingstone.

The book we chose for this adaptation is *Deathtrap Dungeon*, hence the project's name. It is a purely text-based terminal game that explores part of the world of Arton (Yes, the same one from the RPG Tormenta 20!) in a simple adventure of choices, where your decisions shape your path until you exit the Sukumvit dungeon!
